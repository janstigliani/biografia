        Hi, my name is <strong>Jan Stigliani</strong>. <br>
        I'm 24, I live in Castiglione Chiavarese and my aim is to become a renokwn narrative designer. <br>
        I consider gaming the most complete medium, the perfect intersection between the harmony of music,
        the wonder of photography, the depth of writing and the immersiveness of interactivity.
        This is why it has always been my greatest passion and has become the core of my career path.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the years, I have also developed a strong interest in writing,
        a hobby that led to the publication of my book The Dance of Death and the Wind.
        I am also a big fan of cinema, anime and literature, in particular the fantasy genre.

        After graduating in 2019 from the Liceo Marconi Delpino in Chiavari, I initially undertook
        studies as a Laboratory Technician at the University of Genoa. However, I soon realised that path
        did not suit me, leading me to reflect on what I really wanted to do in life.
        The answer became clear: create video games.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2022, I therefore enrolled in the Game Design and Development course at the Vigamus Academy
        in Rome, moving to the capital to follow my passion. During the course, I was able to delve
        into different aspects of game design and work on numerous projects. After obtaining my
        certification, I started collaborating with former classmates and other professionals to develop
        <a href="https://www.mindscrapergame.com/home" target="_blank">Mind Scraper</a>, a graphic adventure in Unity that allows players to discover worlds generated by people's minds.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project's demo was awarded second place at the third edition of Zagarolo Gamehouse,
        a competition promoted by the Lazio Region, which allowed us to meet with experts in the field,
        including professionals from One-O-One Games. Subsequently, an improved version of the demo was
        presented at First Playable 2024 in Florence, receiving positive feedback from the public and experts.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2025, I also undertook a course to obtain the qualification of Full-Stack Programmer,
        in order to expand my programming skills and further enhance my professionalism in the field.
